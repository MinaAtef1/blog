A pubsub system is a messaging system that allows publishers to send messages to subscribers. In this article, we'll explore how to build a simple pubsub system using Postgres. We will look into the basic concepts of a pubsub system, discuss the implementation details, and we'll look into the outbox-inbox pattern.

## Basic Concepts

### Idempotency, consistency, and the outbox-inbox pattern
One of the main challenges of building a pubsub system is ensuring that messages are delivered reliably and consistently. 

#### Failure Scenarios
let's imagine that we have a system_1 that creates orders, and another system_2 that sends an email to the user after the order is created.

- **Scenario 1**: system_1 creates the order, tries to send a message to system_2, but system_2 is down. In this case, the message will be lost, and the user will not receive the email.
- **Scenario 2**: system_1 creates the order, tries to send message to system_2, but system_1 crashes before the message is sent. In this case, the order will be created, but the user will not receive the email.
- **Scenario 3**: system_1 creates the order, sends the message to system_2, but system_2 crashes before processing the message. In this case, the order will be created, but the user will not receive the email.
and so on.

to solve these problems, we need to make sure that the message is delivered reliably and consistently.
here comes the outbox-inbox pattern, the outbox-inbox pattern is a pattern that ensures that messages are delivered reliably and consistently, in a one transactional way.

#### Outbox Table
Now let's imaging that instead of system_1 sends the message directly to system_2, system_1 writes the message to a table called outbox, so in one database transaction, system_1 creates the order and writes the message to the outbox table, if anything goes wrong, the transaction will be rolled back, and the message will not be sent.
So now we are sure that they are consistent, either the order is created and the message is sent, or nothing happens.

#### Inbox Table
Now system_2 will have a table called inbox, that listens to the incoming messages from the outbox table, so system_2 will receive the message, do the processing, and then write the message to the inbox table, so if anything goes wrong, the message will not be written to the inbox table, and a broker can retry sending the message again and again until it receives a success response.

so the main components of the pubsub system will be:

### Main Components
Our pubsub system will consist of three main components:
- **Publisher**: A system that publishes messages to a topic.
- **Outbox**: A table that stores messages published by publishers.

- **Subscriber**: A system that subscribes to a topic to receive messages.
- **Inbox**: A table that stores messages received by subscribers.

- **Broker**: A system that listens for new messages in the outbox and delivers them to the appropriate subscribers.
- **Event Table**: A table that stores the messages delivered by the broker.
- **Subscriber Table**: A table that stores the subscribers and the topics they are subscribed to.
- **Invocation Table**: A table that stores the invocation of the subscribers.

### Message Flow
Here's how our pubsub system will work:
1. A publisher writes a message to the outbox table.
2. The broker listens for new messages in the outbox table.
3. When a new message is added to the outbox table, the broker copies it to its event table.
4. The broker then delivers the message to all subscribers who have subscribed to the topic.
5. Subscribers receive the message do the processing.
6. if the processing is successful, the broker will write the invocation to the invocation table.
7. if the processing is failed, the broker will retry sending the message again.

#### Conclusion
In this article, we explored the basic concepts of a pubsub system and discussed the outbox-inbox pattern. We looked into the main components of a pubsub system and the message flow between them.
