ðŸš€ Excited to share my latest project with you! ðŸŽ‰



I've developed a Django package called "django-search-input-form" that seamlessly integrates Ajax searchable input fields into your Django forms. Whether you need to search model fields or custom data, this package simplifies the process and enhances user experience.



Check it out on GitHub, and I'd love to hear your feedback and suggestions for improvement!
